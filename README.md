# React Context 🍀

React context is an interface for sharing information with other components without explicitly passing the data as props. This means that you can share information between a parent component and a deeply nested child component, or store site-wide data in a single place and access them anywhere in the application. You can even update data from nested components by providing update functions along with the data.
